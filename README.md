# Reversi

To play, compile all files and execute the Game file with two arguments, each either "HUMAN" or "CPU." The first argument corresponds to the first player and the second argument to the second player. Currently, running with argument "CPU" loads the minimax game tree AI as the CPU. However, if another custom Player class is provided, the code can be changed to load the custom class.
